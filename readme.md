# Assessment: Real-World Application - Part A

## Description of Website

### Purpose
The weExplore website is designed to accompany and facilitate weExplore, in running and managing events.

weExplore is a not for profit organisation based in Clayton, Victoria, providing health education to promote holistic health and well-being for the communities. Their mission is to promote a holistic healthy lifestyle. They do this by educating their members in physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health through running events such as cooking classes, pilates, and health seminars. 

The purpose of the website is to provide the ability for weExplore to create events and post them to the site where  webpage their members can sign up to attend the events and receive information about upcoming events.

Finally, it allows the administration of weExplore to have access to a master database of their members. This lets the administration have a greater understanding of their member’s metrics and needs to be able to cater specifically to events of their liking. 

Currently weExplore use MeetUp and word of mouth to promote their events to the community. Through the build of a custom website, weExplore will have further reach and a consistent event management system. 

### Functionality

The main functionality of the weExplore website is the ability for administrators to create events and for members to sign up and confirm their attendance for the events. 

It will contain a feed with upcoming events that are available for members to attend in an easy, informative and friendly design. The website will exemplify the passion and dedication weExplore has to health education and holistic wellbeing. 

Furthermore, the website will allow the administrators of weExplore to have access to a database of their users and the events the users are attending. This will allow them to gain a comprehensive understanding of their user’s wants, needs, and interests concerning their health. 

Finally, the weExplore website will be the primary point of information for the members to find out more about the company, services offered and contact information. This will be accessible through different pages of the website. 

The site will have a main navigation bar to allow ease of accessibility for all pages. It will contain the main events component with a singular event component and the ability to “click” attending events. 

Furthermore, it will contain the functionality to sign-up, login, and sign-out of the members portal. As well as signing in to the administrator portal and display the admin dashboard to create, edit and delete events.
